SUGAR-SYNTAX
Syntactic sugar refers to a feature in a language that allows 
programmers to write code with less typing involved or easier, 
but doesn’t really add any new functionality to the language 
that it didn’t already have.

It makes the code more readable, clear and clean.

For example: 
- Use a ternary operator instead of the well-known if()..else... statement
- const array2 = [...anotherArray, 6, 7, 8]

WEBPACK
It is a module bundler (empaquetador de modulos). It is one of the most
widely used currently for Front-End devs.
Module bundlers help compile the project. It is to prepare code for 
production. Other module bundlers: Rollup and Parcel.

Webpack was created in late 2012. Used for react or angular, implemented on 
well known apps such as: Twitter, Instagra,, Paypal, web version pf whatsapp

Webcap transforma varios archivos (js, hbs, css, sass...) a assets que 
pueda entender el navegador. Tambien, hace un minimizer de estos.

To create build folder, to deploy
>>$ npm run build

Dont run, as it can not be reverted
>>$ npm run eject

TRANSPILING
Process of converting code written in one language into another
For example:
- typescrypt
- jsx (javascript xml)

JSX 
It is javascript + xml
Differences with HTML
- Closing tag is optional in JSX, but we should indicate closure by 
adding the '/' in the opening tag. Meaning we can have only 1 tag but
it must have the '/' at the end to indicate closure.
- Attribute class is renamed to classname in JSX
- we use CamelCase for attributes names.

for react:
- file format: puede ser js o jsx
- Code: inside the return we always use JSX
