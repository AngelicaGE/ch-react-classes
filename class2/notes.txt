React is known for its nice performance. There are 3 things that contribute to this:
1. Virtual DOM
2. React Fiber
3.Reconciliacion

Accessing the DOM is extreamly expensive, Virtual DOM allows us to render only those elements
which changed.

CLI
Command line interface, a method that allows users to interact with a program through a simple text inputs (commands).
React has its own CLI. However, up to now it only allows to create an app.
>>$ create-react-app

now to run move to dir and start 
>>$ cd comission-aguemes
>>$ npm start

remove whole dir
>>$ rm -fR <dir>

>>$ git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
>>$ git branch -M main
>>$ git add .
